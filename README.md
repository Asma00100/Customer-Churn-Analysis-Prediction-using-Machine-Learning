# Churn-Analysis-&-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
End-to-end customer churn analysis and machine learning–based prediction using Python and Power BI and Machine Learning.


## Overview
This project focuses on analyzing customer churn behavior and predicting future churn using machine learning.  
It follows an end-to-end workflow starting from data analysis and visualization to predictive modeling and dashboarding.

The project includes two Power BI dashboards:
- One for churn analysis based on historical data
- One for churn prediction based on machine learning output

---

## Dataset
The dataset contains customer demographic details, service usage information, and contract-related features used to analyze and predict customer churn.

---

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Machine Learning
- Scikit-learn
- Power BI

---

## Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading**
   - Loaded customer data into Jupyter Notebook using Python.

2. **Data Cleaning & EDA**
   - Handled missing values, corrected data types, and encoded categorical variables.
   - Performed exploratory data analysis to identify churn patterns and key drivers.

3. **Churn Analysis Dashboard (Pre-ML)**
   - Built a Power BI dashboard using the cleaned dataset to visualize churn insights and KPIs.

4. **Machine Learning Model**
   - Trained a machine learning model to predict customer churn.
   - Evaluated model performance and generated predictions on new data.

5. **Churn Prediction Dashboard (Post-ML)**
   - Created a second Power BI dashboard using the prediction results to identify high-risk customers.

## Dashboards

### Churn Analysis Dashboard (Pre-ML)
This dashboard provides insights into historical customer data and highlights key churn drivers.

### Churn Prediction Dashboard (Post-ML)
This dashboard visualizes machine learning predictions and helps identify customers who are likely to churn.


---

## Results
- Identified key factors contributing to customer churn
- Successfully built a machine learning model to predict churn
- Visualized both historical insights and future churn risk using Power BI dashboards

---

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates an end-to-end customer churn analysis and prediction workflow, combining data analysis, machine learning, and business intelligence to support data-driven decision-making.
